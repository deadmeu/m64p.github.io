## Welcome to m64p (mupen64plus + GLideN64 + a GUI)

You can download binary builds for Windows and Linux [here](http://m64p.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/). They are 64-bit builds, the Linux build is built on Ubuntu 16.04

m64p uses [mupen64plus-gui](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-gui), a brand new mupen64plus frontend written in Qt5. It supports all thing things you'd expect from a frontend (savestate management, pausing, screenshots, etc..).

m64p comes bundled with [GLideN64](https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64) for the graphics plugin. It should give you the best out-of-the-box experience available for N64 gaming.

## TODO

mupen64plus-gui doesn't yet support controller configuration, but it's coming! It does support auto-configuration, so most controllers should work without any need for intervention/

It also lacks cheat support, also coming soon.
