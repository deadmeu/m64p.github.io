## Welcome to m64p (mupen64plus + GLideN64 + a GUI)

You can download binary builds for Windows and Linux [here](http://m64p.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).

m64p uses [mupen64plus-gui](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-gui), a brand new mupen64plus frontend written in Qt5. It supports all thing things you'd expect from a frontend (savestate management, pausing, screenshots, etc..).

m64p comes bundled with [GLideN64](https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64) for the graphics plugin. It should give you the best out-of-the-box experience available for N64 gaming.

### Compatibility ###

This is likely the most compatible version of mupen64plus you're going to come across. It can play games like Resident Evil 2, Rogue Squadron, Pokemon Snap, and World Driver Championship "out-of-the-box" (without the need to fiddle with settings, plugins or anything of the sort).

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. There is no installer, just unzip and play!

I am only aware of 3 games that work on Project64 and not here:
* All-Star Baseball 2000
* All-Star Baseball 2001
* NFL Quarterback Club 99

Unless you'd like to play one of those games, this should provide you a good alternative to Project64.

If you know of any other games that work better on Project64, I would love to hear about it [here](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-GLideN64/issues)
