## Welcome to m64p (mupen64plus + GLideN64 + a GUI)

You can download binary builds for Windows and Linux [here](http://m64p.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/). There are 32 and 64-bit builds, the Linux build is built on Ubuntu 16.04

m64p uses [mupen64plus-gui](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-gui), a brand new mupen64plus frontend written in Qt5. It supports all thing things you'd expect from a frontend (savestate management, pausing, screenshots, etc..).

m64p comes bundled with [GLideN64](https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64) for the graphics plugin. It should give you the best out-of-the-box experience available for N64 gaming.

### 32-bit vs 64-bit build ###

The 32-bit build has a new, and potentially faster, dynarec. It is not as compatible as the older, more mature dynarec in the 64-bit build. Most computers are fast enough to handle the older dynarec. You should probably use the 64-bit build.

### Compatibility ###

This is likely the most compatible version of mupen64plus you're going to come across. It can play games like Resident Evil 2, Rogue Squadron, Pokemon Snap, and World Driver Championship "out-of-the-box" (without the need to fiddle with settings, plugins or anything of the sort).

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. There is no installer, just unzip and play!

I am only aware of 5 games that work on Project64 and not here:
* All-Star Baseball 2000
* All-Star Baseball 2001
* NFL Quarterback Club 99
* International Track & Field 2000
* Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 1

Unless you'd like to play one of those games, this should provide you a good alternative to Project64.

If you know of any other games that work better on Project64, I would love to hear about it [here](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-GLideN64/issues)
