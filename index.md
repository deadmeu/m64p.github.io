## Welcome to m64p (mupen64plus + GLideN64 + a GUI)

You can download binary builds for Windows and Linux [here](http://m64p.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/). There are 32 and 64-bit builds, the Linux build is built on Ubuntu 16.04

m64p uses [mupen64plus-gui](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-gui), a brand new mupen64plus frontend written in Qt5. It supports all thing things you'd expect from a frontend (savestate management, pausing, screenshots, etc..).

m64p comes bundled with [GLideN64](https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64) for the graphics plugin. It should give you the best out-of-the-box experience available for N64 gaming.

### Compatibility ###

This is likely the most compatible version of mupen64plus you're going to come across. It can play games like Resident Evil 2, Rogue Squadron, Pokemon Snap, and World Driver Championship "out-of-the-box" (without the need to fiddle with settings, plugins or anything of the sort).

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. There is no installer, just unzip and play!
